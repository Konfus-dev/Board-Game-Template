# Board Game Template
An template for physics based board game simulators.
Features one placeholder board game called Deadwood, a interactable rule book and notebook to keep track of points, physics based dice, interaction and impact sounds, and a card deck that can be drawn from and shuffled. This is not meant to enforce rules, that is for the players to do if they choose.
In the future:
  Will have networked multiplayer.
  Will support holding card, objects snapping to place, etc...
